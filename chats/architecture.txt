High-level blueprint
1) Ingestion: build a truthful, time-aware picture of the cluster

K8s Watchers (client-go informers)

Watch Pods/Deployments/ReplicaSets/Jobs/CronJobs/DaemonSets/Nodes/Services/Ingresses/Events, etc.

Normalize each change into a canonical record ({kind, ns, name, uid, resourceVersion, op, ts, manifest, status}).

Kubernetes Events & Audit

Watch v1/Events (reasons/warnings) and enable Audit Sink for CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE with requestor, verb, old/new object (truth source for “who changed what”).

Signals (metrics/logs/traces)

Metrics: Prometheus scraping + long-term store (Thanos or VictoriaMetrics — great for long retention).

Logs: Fluent Bit → Loki (you already use Fluent Bit; Loki simplifies k8s log search).

Traces: OpenTelemetry SDK/Collector → Tempo/Jaeger (optional but powerful for “why was it slow at 14:03?”).

Why: Watchers + audit give accurate state diffs; Prom/Loki/OTel cover performance & incidents, all time-stamped for “time travel”.

2) Storage: current cache + historical state

Current State Cache

The watchers feed an in-memory cache (shared informer/listers) and a small Redis (optional) for fast lookups.

Historical Resource Store (time-travel) — two good patterns:

Cassandra/Scylla (or Astra DB): append-only per resource with time bucketing.

Partition: (kind, namespace, name, day); cluster by ts DESC.

Columns: uid, resourceVersion, op (ADDED/MODIFIED/DELETED), manifest (JSON/YAML), status.

Query “state at T”: fetch latest record ≤ T (check day T and previous day for boundary).

Scales linearly; writes are cheap; you’re already Cassandra-savvy.

Timescale/ClickHouse if you prefer SQL analytics / ad-hoc queries.

Object Storage (S3/MinIO)

Periodic full snapshots (e.g., every 10–15 min) + compacted diffs for cheap long-term retention.

Search & labels

For flexible label/field queries, index a projection into OpenSearch (name/ns/kind/labels/ownerRefs) — optional but handy.

Why: You need append-only, high-throughput writes and predictable reads for “as of” queries. Cassandra fits beautifully; ClickHouse/Timescale is great if you want SQL-first explorations.

3) Relationship index (ownership & topology)

Build a lightweight graph view from ownerReferences and selectors: Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods; Service ↔ Pods; Pod → Node; Ingress → Service, etc.

Store as:

A simple edges table (src, rel, dst, ts) in your historical store, and

A materialized, current graph in memory (or Redis) for quick traversals.

Use it to answer “which pods serve app X?”, “what did app X look like last Tuesday 09:12?”, “what node drained these pods?”

Why: Many SRE questions are relationship traversals. A small graph index keeps answers instant.

4) Semantic indexing (RAG for natural questions)

Document builders turn manifests, events, rollout history, alerts, and postmortem snippets into text chunks with metadata ({kind/ns/name, ts_range, links}).

Embeddings + Vector DB (Astra DB Vector / pgvector / Qdrant / Weaviate):

Create time-aware embeddings (store from_ts/to_ts) so retrieval matches the user’s asked time window.

Retriever first honors structured filters (kind/ns/name/time) → then semantic top-k for free-form parts (“what caused the crashloop?”).

Why: RAG makes free-form Q&A land on the right docs, while tool calls (below) answer precise, numeric questions.

5) Tooling adapters (the agent’s “hands & eyes”)

Expose narrow, auditable tools the LLM can call:

K8s Read API: get_resource, list_resources, get_history_at_time, diff_at(times t1, t2).

Graph: related(kind/ns/name, hops, at_time).

Metrics: query_promql(q, time_range).

Logs: query_loki(labels, q, time_range).

Traces: query_traces(service, time_range, filters).

Change History: “who/what changed?” against Audit + history.

Actions (guard-railed; see §7):

restart_deployment(ns, name) (patch spec.template.metadata.annotations["restartedAt"]).

rollout_status(ns, kind, name).

kubectl_apply(dry_run|server_side, manifest) (Helm/Kustomize supported).

taint_node(node, key=value:Effect) / cordon/uncordon/drain.

scale(ns, kind, name, replicas).

edit(ns, kind, name, strategic_merge_patch).

Why: Make capabilities explicit and testable. The LLM becomes a planner that composes these tools, not a shell with cluster-admin.

6) Orchestration (the “brain”)

LLM + Agent framework: LangGraph / Guidance / Semantic-Kernel (any that supports tool calling and guardrails).

Planner → Executor separation: Planner decides which tools to call; Executor runs them; no direct shell.

Time-aware prompting: The system prompt always injects the user’s target time (default “now”) to bias queries and retrieval.

Deterministic chains first (metrics/logs/history queries), then LLM only for language synthesis/explanations.

Why: Keeps the assistant reliable and debuggable; you can unit-test tools and flows.

7) Safety, policy, and approvals (non-negotiable)

RBAC: The agent uses a dedicated ServiceAccount with least-privilege, namespace-scoped Roles. For actions, use impersonation or short-lived, escalated tokens.

Policy Engine: OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno checks on intended mutations (e.g., forbid node taints in prod without approval).

Dry-run by default: Every mutating action produces a plan (server-side dry-run + diff) for the user to confirm.

Approval workflow: Slack/Teams confirmation with change summary, risk score, and rollback plan.

Audit: Persist every tool call, input, output, user, and final object diff (also ship to k8s Audit + your store).

Rate limits & circuit breakers on mutating tools.

Why: “Chat-ops” without guardrails is risky. These controls make changes reviewable and reversible.

8) Interfaces

Chat: Slack/Teams + Web UI with a time slider and deep links to Grafana/Loki panels used in answers.

CLI: kagent ask "...?" --at 2025-08-31T14:00Z and kagent apply --plan.

Dashboards: Grafana for metrics & logs (re-use your stack).

Typical flows
A) “What did Deployment orders look like yesterday 14:00?”

Agent normalizes the question → time window.

Tool: get_history_at_time(Deployment, ns, name, 14:00) → from Cassandra history.

Tool: related(...) to pull ReplicaSet/Pods at that time.

(Optional) Metrics/logs queries for that time window.

LLM summarizes, shows evidence links.

B) “Restart orders and watch the rollout”

Tool: restart_deployment(ns, name) with dry-run → show diff.

Policy check (OPA) + Approval in Slack.

Apply; then rollout_status with backoff; stream progress.

Persist action + outcome to audit log.

Data model snippet (Cassandra example)
CREATE TABLE k8s.resource_history (
  kind text,
  namespace text,
  name text,
  day date,
  ts timestamp,
  uid text,
  resource_version text,
  op text,                -- ADDED|MODIFIED|DELETED
  manifest text,          -- JSON or YAML string
  status text,            -- compacted status
  PRIMARY KEY ((kind, namespace, name, day), ts)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (ts DESC);


Query “state at T”: read first row ≤ T from partition(s) day(T) and day(T-1); if latest is DELETED, the object didn’t exist then.

Keep a small compaction job that stores periodic “full” snapshots to bound replay time.

Guarded action example (restart Deployment)

Build patch:
{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"kubectl.kubernetes.io/restartedAt":"2025-09-06T10:15:00Z"}}}}}

kubectl apply --dry-run=server -f <rendered> → collect diff.

Run OPA checks (namespace, time, PDB, SLO blast radius).

Slack approval → apply → kubectl rollout status monitor → emit audit trail & links to Grafana/Loki panel for the rollout window.

MVP in 2–3 iterations

Read-only: watchers → Cassandra history; connect Prom/Loki; build 5–6 deterministic tools; LangGraph agent that answers scoped questions (“as of” supported).

Action w/ guardrails: add dry-run planning, OPA checks, Slack approval, and 3 safe actions (restart, scale, cordon/uncordon).

Time-aware RAG: add embeddings over manifests/events/postmortems, plus relationship index for richer “why” answers.

Why this works

Truthful: Uses authoritative APIs and immutable history; LLM never hallucinates values—it calls tools.

Auditable & safe: Every change is planned, approved, and logged.

Scalable: All chosen stores scale horizontally and are CNCF-friendly.

Incremental: You can ship read-only value fast, then layer actions with policy.

If you want, I can sketch a Helm chart layout and the exact RBAC/OPA policies for the first three actions (restart, scale, taint) next.
